Bud Rot Stop is a revolutionary new product that doesn’t just protect against Bud Rot – it destroys existing infections and restores your plants back to full health. An amazing innovation, Bud Rot Stop works by effectively forcing the Botrytis (bud rot) spores to germinate on your plants and then eliminates them as they form.
